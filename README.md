# Smart Electric Scooter: Enhancing Safety and Comfort with Microcontroller Technology
The thesis focuses on developing a prototype system that can be implemented in electric scooters, using the Arduino Mega 2560 microcontroller and ESP32. The system aims to improve the driving comfort and ensure greater safety for electric scooter users. 

  A system for sending SOS messages with the current location, as well as lighting systems (turn signals, brake lights, and night lights) and a smoke detection system were developed as part of improving the safety the users of electric scooters. To improve the comfort of using the scooter, a password-protected mobile app to manage the scooter was developed with functions such as an antitheft lock, a sound and light system to locate the scooter, and a view of atmospheric parameters such as temperature and humidity. 
  
  The thesis provides a detailed description of the principles of operation of the individual elements used, presents the housing design, and explains the principle of operation of the systems from a software perspective.
  
  The set goals have been fully achieved, and in the final part of the thesis, future development possibilities for the project using the API offered by Google are presented, and an analysis of the effectiveness of implementing an anti-alcohol lock is carried out. Tests were also conducted to verify the cooperation of the designed systems as a functional whole.
